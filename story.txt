As I was traveling down the Hauptstrasse, you wouldn't believe what I spotted.
A Biergarten that appeared to be completly vaccant was on fire.
I dropped my Bratwurst and called my Freundin on the phone.
I put on my lederhose then went to the baeckerie for a gebaeck.
manche Hunde ate the Bratwurst and ripped my lederhose in the process.  Sad.
So sad that I went to the ratskeller to drink my sorrows away.
I saw a apfelkuchekn buried in the corner of the ratskeller and shared it with my hund.
My hund was very happy, so I took them to a wettbewerbsfaehig hund show.
It was hot at the hund show, but luckily they happend to have a powerful Klimaanlage.
I felt guilty though because I hate contributing to Klimawandel.
If we all work together, and lift people out of armut, more people can 
focus on mitigating harm caused by klimnawendel!
Walking down the street in Berlin, I was drawn to the scent of sizzling Bratwurst coming from a nearby Baeckerei.
