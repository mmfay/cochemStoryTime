As I was traveling down the Hauptstrasse, you wouldn't believe what I spotted.
A Biergarten that appeared to be completly vaccant was on fire.
I dropped my Bratwurst and called my Freundin on the phone.
I put on my lederhose then went to the baeckerie for a gebaeck.
manche Hunde ate the Bratwurst and ripped my lederhose in the process.  Sad.
So sad that I went to the ratskeller to drink my sorrows away.
I saw a apfelkuchekn buried in the corner of the ratskeller and shared it with my hund.
My hund was very happy, so I took them to a wettbewerbsfaehig hund show.
It was hot at the hund show, but luckily they happend to have a powerful Klimaanlage.
I felt guilty though because I hate contributing to Klimawandel.
If we all work together, and lift people out of armut, more people can
focus on mitigating harm caused by klimnawendel!
I decided to donate money to Greta Thunberg.  She's meine Heldin!
However, now I am in armut.
I then decided to go to Berlin to eat Apfelkuchen to make myself feel better. 
The Gebaeck in Germany are the best because the Baeckerei in germany are the best.
