As I was traveling down the Hauptstrasse, you wouldn't believe what I spotted.
A Biergarten that appeared to be completly vaccant was on fire.
I dropped my Bratwurst and called my Freundin on the phone.
I put on my lederhose then went to the baeckerie for a gebaeck.
manche Hunde ate the Bratwurst and ripped my lederhose in the process.  Sad.
So sad that I went to the ratskeller to drink my sorrows away.
I saw a apfelkuchekn buried in the corner of the ratskeller and shared it with my hund.
